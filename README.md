# Resource Wall

Resource Wall is a Pinterest for learners. 

It brings you links to all sorts of learning resources in one place, allowing you to like, comment and rate resource based on how good you believe they are. 

One of the best features is being able to rate resources. This allows users and visitors to chose resources based on the best articles, videos, blogs and tutorials that the community has previously chosen. When you rate a resource, you save other users time in searching the web for good reasources and are contributing to the RW community.
